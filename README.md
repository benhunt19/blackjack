# How to play:
# 1. Enter the number of players you want to play
# 2. Number cards have their value and face cards have value 10 (ace is always 1 here)
# 3. You are aiming to get 21. Twist to get a new card and stick if you are happy with your total, if you go over 21 you go bust and lose
# 4. The winner is the player that gets closest to but not greater than 21 as a total
